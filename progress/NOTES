So what kind of features should I look for?

So I mentioned that I wanted to have basically two different training sets. I wanted to predict views of a video based on the data of all previous views in the channel, and I wanted to have a broad similarity between the channel and the rest of channels.

So for the channel specific model, we have

commentCount, likeCount, dislikeCount, viewCount,
and then the times. For now, screw the times. Just look at the metrics for the last 3 videos.

Let me try to get that up and running for a single channel.

Ok I need to grab some data sources!
